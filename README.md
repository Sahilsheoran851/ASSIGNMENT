## Exercise 8 - Code Cell to Multiply and Add Numbers

a = 5
b = 4
multiply = a * b
add = a + b


## Exercise 8 -  Convert minutes to hours

minutes = 150
hours = minutes / 60
print(f"{minutes} minutes is equal to {hours} hours.")

print("Multiplication result:", multiply)
print("Addition result:", add)
